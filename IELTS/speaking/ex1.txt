母語使用者的回答

Because of being relatively close to the equator, Taiwan has a subtropical climate. 
Therefore summers are long, humid, oppressive and at times are almost unbearable.
The so-called "winter" months on the other hand bring cooler temperatures, but never get below freezing. 
Taiwan winters are characterized by extended periods of heavy rain and gloomy overcast days that can last for weeks at a time. The most pleasant months are the end of September to the beginning of November. This time of year has milder temperatures, clear, sunny days and low humidity.
