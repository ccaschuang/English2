Letter:　是General IELTS 的task 1要會的東西，
一般需要花費20分鐘來寫。

一般的書信集中在五大類：

Making a request
Making suggestions
Making an apology
Making a complaint
Thank-you letter

但也有少數類似informal的信件：比方說朋友間的書信等等。

如果說A類考題是在看學生有沒有能力念大學，那邊General類就是看有沒有能力可以在英語國家生活。

在Letter
	1: 如果題目給的資訊不夠豐富，可以允許加上一些聯想，但切忌跑題。
	2: 雖然是書信，但是還是英文考試，用詞不能過於口語話或是俚語話(slangy)
	3: 不要因為力求過於完美，而超過了時間。


因為要150字，所以一般是以四段式為主

第一段 1~2句，寫出寫此信的目地，請求、建議還是感謝，還有介紹自己
		This is ccas from Synopsys. I would like to ...

第二段 主體段：  3~4句
	寫明是為什麼促使自己寫這封信，

	大致說明自己面試的情況/或是自己做了什麼，產生了什麼影響……etc


第三段：主體段：
	提出自己希望的效果，
	細化自己的請求/或是建議的最核心部份
	…etc

第四段：希望盡快得到回音

	比如說收到回信，或是希望對方可以盡快采取動作…etc

========================================

分析：這是Request信  一般寫四段，
	第一段說明自己會帶一些人到當地旅行
	第二段說明一些要求
	第三段可以有一些想像，(如希望旅店可以提供其他的幫助)
	第四段：希望盡快得到回覆

Dear Sir/Madam, 
I am writing to seek accommodation in the Snoy Mountains for a group of students from Perth.
We expect to be the Snowy Mountains between June 1 and June 12. There are fourteen people in our group, five men and seven women, and a married couple. The five men will accept dormitory accommodation, and the women are happy to share rooms, but the married couple would like a double room. We hope to keep our expenses as low as possible.

Please tell me about recreational services in the area. TheGroup will bring their own boots for bushwalking, but we are hoping to hire equipment for other sports, like skiing. Some of our group will want to hire geological picks and other equipment, if possible. We also need to know about access to caves and other intersting geological features in the area.

I am looking forward to receiving information about the Student Hostel Services and other facilities.

Yours sincerely,
Amanda Chan

You should write at least 150 words.
You do NOT need to write your own address.
Begin your letters as follows:

Dear

典型的建議信可以分成四段：

Dear Sir.Madam,

I am delighted to learn that your library is taking steps to upgrade its equipment and I am writing this letter to offer my suggestions.

As is known to all in this neighborhood, your library is not only essential for the local students, it also plays a crucial role in the work and leisure of the local professionals and retirees. therefor, in my view, this library should be equipped with a wide range of equipment and facilities, including video and film collections ,projectors, recording equipment and multi-media rooms to better facilitate the work, research and entertainment needs of the locals. 

Most importantly, more computers with access to the internet should be available in this library. As a biologist, I am very interested in the information about the latest developments in the biological labs around the world. To my great disappointment, only one computer in your library has Internet access. this situation should be changed immediately. Otherwise, more local residents would end up feeling disappointed with this library. 

Since the information age has made this local library all the more important to our lives, I would be grateful indeed if you can take my proposals into serious consideration.

Sincerley,
Steve Atkins
========================================
Making an apology 道歉信：

	．apologize
	．describe what action you will take.

You should write at least 150 words. 
You do not need to write your address.

Dear James, 
I was very shocked to get your letter saying that the noise from my flat has been spoiling your evening and causing your some distress. I am really, really sorry about that. I have no idea that you would be able to hear so much, so I hope you will accept my apologies.

As you may have guessed, I am trying to reft my kitchen in the evenings when I get home from work. Unfortunately it is all taking longer than expected and I have been having problems with getting things to fit properly.  This has meant a lot of banging and hammering. 

As the kitchen is still not finished, I have decided to call in a professional builder who will finish the work in the next day or two. He'll work only during daytime hours, so you won't be disturbed in the evenings again, I promise.

Sorry to have caused the problems.


Regards,
Bill

Making a complaint 抱怨信
	You have bought a washing machine (Sanyo XQB 50-68). First you found that the machine damaged your clotes, and you had it changed. Then you found that the new one seriously entangled the clothes.

	Write to the manager of the factory to complain about it.

You should write at least 150 words.
You do NOT need to write your own address.

Dear Sir or Madam, 

I am writing to compalin about a product made by your factory.

A few months ago I purchased a washing machine (Sanyo XQB 50-68) produced by your factory. After a few weeks I found that it had seriously damaged the clothes. I asked you to change one for me, which you did. Now I want to ask you to change this one for me again.

This one does not damage my clothes any more, but I have found that it entangles the clothes seriously and when it automatically begins to spin the water out, the machine shakes so heavily that it stops by itself. In the instruction booklet you have not methioned this defect and neighter have you told the user how to solve the problem. I am quite annoyed by the fact that sometimes when I came back from work to take the clothes out to dry, they were still unwashed. When I am home, I have to tend it frequently to untwist the entangled clothes. Is that what you call your machine "fully automatic"? 

Please change a new one for me that will not entangle the clothes. Otherwise, I would ask you to give my money back, or I would complain to the Consumers' Assoication.

Yours sincerely,
Jack.

Dear David:
	I am writing this letter to thank you for the guidance you gave me. I was a perfect stranger when arriving at this city. Once I lost myself for not knowing the way in a downtown street, although I stopped to ask some people for direction. As you know that was the first time for me to come up to this big city.

	I bought a guidebook, but there were still difficulties in going round the city. The streets and shops puzzled me so much taht I would rahter stay indoors. It is your valuable guidance that has enabled me to go about the city without losing myself.  I thank you very much for your kind help. Now I begin to know how to take the proper trolley-buses or buses. Yesterday I went downtown with some of my schoolmates to buy some stationery.

	Lession will begin in a few days. I will come over to see you some day next week and tell you everything that has happened to me.
															Yours,
															Linda
