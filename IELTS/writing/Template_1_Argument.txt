1: Arguments 辯論類模板

第一段：介紹背景，並引出話題
first : 寫入背景
	In the present age,... are playing significant roles in our lives
	In the present age, the issue of ... is increasingly disturbing.
second:
	But in the mean time, whether...(辯論話題) has sparked much debate.
third:
	Some people assert that... while many others argue that...
fourth:
	Personally, I am in favor of  the former/ the latter  view. (前者或後者)

P.S. 1、2 句可省略，但只要寫了，一定要扣題，如果偏離題目太遠，不如不寫。

第二段寫自己傾向的觀點： 至少要有三個分論點，每個分論點各自有1~2句支持句

	說明自己的論點是有說服力(或是有證據)可以表明……
	Convincing arguments can be made that... 
	
	(第一個理由)
	To start with...
	Therefore(因此),....

	第二個理由
	Moreover,...
	Specifically(具體來說),...

	第三個理由
	Lastly, ... 
	In other words,...

	其中的支持句，都盡量寫成複雜句，可以用之前的連接詞，使句型複雜化。 
	(可以參考之前的連接詞conjunction使用。)

第三段寫不傾向的一方， 需要先支持兩句，再指出這種觀點的不足之處。
	
	1:承認___(不傾向的觀點)
	Admittedly, … 

	2: 第一個理由
	The reason for this is that...(寫一個理由)

	3: 支持句， 
	Obviously, (支持前句), ... 

	4:寫這種觀點的不足之處。
	Even so,...

	5: 舉例支持4
	for instance…

	另外：3，5的支持句盡量寫成複雜句

第四段：結尾，一般是3~5句，
	In summary, I would concede that... (我承認…)

	儘管如此
	Despite that, ... 

	提出應該怎麼做，就是提一個建議。
	Overall, I am convinced that ... should... 


	結尾也可以壓成兩句：
	ex: 
	In summary ,I would concede that..., even though... 
	or 
	Overall, I am convinced that... should....

辯論類模版B:

第四段開頭：給出自己論點會用到的句型
	1:if 是兩種觀點要你辯論
	As far as I am concerned, I am in favor of the former (or latter) view.
	
	As far as I am concerned = To (or In ) my mind = From my own perspective

	Speaking for myself, I think ... = Personally, ...  = In my view, ... = As I see it...

	In favor of = favor = support = incline towards = side with

	View = opinion = point of view = notion

	２：if題目只有一種觀點，而你主要是偏向支持方：
	Personally, I agree with their view, but I would qualify it to some extent (or somewhat).

	Personally, I think their view has considerable merit.

	Speaking for myself, I agree with their proposition, wiht certain qualifications.

	Personally, I sympathize with their view. 
		sympathize: 同情

	To my mind, the merits (or strength/strong points) of their view outweigh (or prevail over/outbalance) the demerits (or weakness/weak points).

	I can agree with the view, but with reservations.

	As I see it, there is more to it than that.

	Personally, I think their view is only partly true.

    at best不需要加the, 此為adv  ，意思是"最好"
    	ex: If he drops the course now, at best he’ll get an incomplete, and he could fail.

    Personally, I think this view overlooks important factors of this issue.

    I think their view is overly simplistic.

    I think their view is over generalized.

    I found their view unconvincing (or unpersuasive/problematic/somewhat) untenable
    	persuasive 有說服力的/unpersuasive沒說服力的
    	problematic 有問題的
    	somewhat 有些

    	untenable: adj  站不住腳的。

    I think their view amounts to an oversimplification.
