連接詞Conjunction是複雜句使用的基礎，不需要太過複雜，除了 and , or 等之外，還需要熟記各場合所需要使用的連接詞

不需要全部的連接詞都背下來，只需要各個場合該使用的各自背一、兩個即可。


下面這三個是ielts範文常見的加分詞，很少人使用，但是可以的話熟記其使用面向。 不要用錯。
in terms of (在...方面，就…而言)

Regardless of (不管...)

For the sake of (為了改善……)

On the one hand... on the other hand, 

Example:
(錯誤用法)
On the one hand, moving large companies to the countryside may reduce the tax revenue of the city government. 
On the other hand, this measure can effectively relieve the pressure on the city transportation.
<--- On the one hand/the other hand一定是用來表達正、反語氣。不可以同時使用正面語氣。

(正確用法)
On the one hand, they work slowly. But one the other hand, they always finish the job.

Example:
In terms of... (在...方面，就…而言)  用來限定某一觀點的適用範圍，因此特別能體現出思維的嚴密性。

* 常用句型
These children are often spoilt, not in term of love and attention because working parents do not have time for this, but in more material ways.

High-quality nursery schools could be established that would support families in terms of raising the next generation.



spoilt ：寵壞了
 spoilt children
 unspolit

 spoil的過去式 v. 1: 溺愛, 寵
 				 2: 弄壞、搞砸、腐壞
    ex:
    	He tried not to let the bad news spoil his evening.
    	The oil spill has spoiled the whole beautiful coastline.


Regardless of (不管) ：中文和no matter差不多，但是regardless of 後面可以加名詞、動名詞、子句(就是個n就對了)
   no matter只能加子句。

   There is more to the skill than a learned technique and this extra talent cannot be taught, no matter how frequently a child practices.

   They are allowed to have whatever they want, regardless of price, and to behave as they please.

   Others think the true function of a university should be to give access to knowledge for its own sake, regardless of whether the course is useful to employers.


for the sake of 為了… ，為了改善……
	有時候等於because of. 但更精確的解釋是in order to help, improve or bring advantage to ...  
	     所以通常是為了正面好處(improving)，反面意思不能使用此連接詞。
	ex:
	I'm trying to keep life normal for the sake of my two boys.

	They were very unhappily married but kept up appearances for the sake of their children.

	Today, many elderly people prefer to live in the countryside for the sake of their health.

要注意，有些特定詞其實不是可以完全替換，使用時要注意一些特殊詞性。

用來替換And
1. 和 and 意思相近：also, besides, likewise,  furthermore ,moreover, not only… but also, in addition to 等等。
 
I like reading and watching movies. 這句話用其他的連接詞或連接性副詞，要如何改寫呢？
*** I like reading, also watching movies.
*** Besides reading, I like watching movies.
*** I like reading, watching movies likewise.
*** I like reading books, furthermore ( moreover) novels.
*** I like not only reading, but also watching movies.
 
In addition to my fixed pay, I got a lot of tips.
除了固定薪水外，我還得到不少小費。

Furthermore, I bought a coat and a jacket for the coming winter.
另外，我買了外套和夾克應付將近的冬天。

我們也來看看這些連接詞或連接性副詞的其他例句：
 
Also: I am 28 years old. Helen is also.
Besides: It rains heavily. Besides, the roads are nearly impassable.
Likewise: To achieve your goal, you must have ambition; likewise you need to exert more efforts.
Furthermore ( moreover ) : Bicycling is a good exercise ; furthermore ( moreover ), it doesn’t  pollute the air .
Not only…but also: The car not only is economical but also feels good to drive.
 

用來替換but
和 but意思相近：however, still, nevertheless, conversely…… 等。
He is handsome but I don’t like him. 這句話用其他的連接詞或連接性副詞，要如何改寫呢？
*** He is handsome. However, I don’t like him.
*** He is handsome, still I don’t like him.
*** He is handsome; nevertheless, I don’t like him.
*** He is a handsome man; conversely, he is not smart.
其他例句：
However: I feel a bit tired. However, I can hold on.
Still: The hotel was terrible. Still, we were lucky with the weather.
Nevertheless: She was angry; nevertheless, she listened to me.
Conversely: My mother prefers to keep a cat at home; conversely, my father likes to have a dog.


用來替換because/because of 
和 because / because of 意思相近： because ［因為］，是連接詞，意思相近的有 due to the fact that, for the reason that。有一個大家也常用的because of，是介係詞片語，意思相近的有 by reason of, resulting from。
 
以下含有because 或because of的句子，一樣試試用不同的字詞替換。
 
He passed the test because he really studied hard.
*** He passed the test due to the fact that (for the reason that) he really studied hard.
 
The poor stray dog finally had a new home because of Mary’s kindness.
*** The poor stray dog finally had a new home resulting from (by reason of) Mary’s kindness.


用來替換so 
和 so意思相近的有　accordingly, consequently, therefore, hence
So 的意思為［所以，因此］，表示因果關係。
Peter lowered his voice so his mother couldn't hear. 也試著用連接性副詞來改寫吧！
 
*** Peter lowered his voice. Accordingly, his mother couldn’t hear.
*** Peter lowered his voice; therefore, his mother couldn’t hear.

He was in the middle of something; therefore, he couldn’t make it tonight.
他很忙，所以他今晚不能來。

They all love ice cream; hence they want to open a dessert shop together.
他們都喜歡冰淇淋，所以他們想一起開個甜點店。

(Accordingly要注意，通常只會放在句首)

特殊句形：雙重否定：

	It is not unrealistic to promote more job satisfaction in any job.

	These days, it is not uncommon that young people have a break from studying after graduating from high school.

	Not surprisingly, student who are under constant stress in their studies may suffer from psychological problems or even commit crimes.

	Not surprisingly:不出所料。 (這個詞雖然只有單一否定，但是意思很接近於雙重否定，故放在這邊。)

其他的連接詞：

Indeed   確實
Admittedly,  (用在句首)  確實
