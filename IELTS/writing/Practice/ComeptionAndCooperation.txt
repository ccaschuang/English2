Question
Some people think that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged. Others believe that children who are taught to co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults.
Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.



Nowadays,  Competition and co-operate is one of the most controversial issue about the education for children. Some people think that we should train the children to be more competitive because that's the real life it is. On the other hand, Some parents like to let their child cooperate with his/her classmates and they don't want their child be under giant pressure. I'll discuss both view below.

Cooperation is quite typical in human society. Maybe you can success without other's help--If you are really excellent. But you can not win a big competition if you are only one people. Big companies such as Google and Facebook are really successful, but they are not only CEOs in their companies. They gather thousands of engineers and lots of researchers, sales and project managers. If the parents don't develop the cooperation spirit, the children might be hard to cooperate with others after they grow up. Moreover, to cooperate with other classmates can also help the children to know how to compete. Such as basketball games or hockey games, you can not play the game without team members. Children can learn cooperate and compete at the same time.

In the meantime, some educators and parents disagree. They think that the competition is inevitable. Having tests, getting admission from famous school, promotion and lots of the chances are not enough for all students. We can not pretend that the competition is not exist. They still have to compete with other colleges for promotion even they get into a big company. The sooner they learn how to compete, the higher probabilities they can be in front of all other classmates. 

  In my opinion, I don't think that competition and cooperation are both important.  Without teamwork, the students may not doing bigger things. Without the competition, they may not be set up or they'll getting harder to get their own accomplishment. The teachers and parents must find a balance between them. In fact, lots of the sports are training the cooperation and competition at the same time.
