at least 250 words,


It's more often to see some people to have a gap year after they graduate from high school and before they enter to the college. It has both pros and cons. For my personal aspect, I am in favor of going out if they don't know what they exactly want. I'll disucss both of the view points below.

To start with, in my country, most of students only know how to study and how to pass the test. They really don't know what's their dream life and work.  Some students even don't understand the difference between software engineering and electric engineering. They just choose the department by the order. Therefore, to travel or work can really help them to know the real world. Moreover, traveling and working can borader their view and enlarge their personal resources. They can get more advice to help them choose what they want to learn and which department they want to enter. Actually, some MBAs only admit the students who have the really work experience. You can not make a cart behind closed doors. In the last. I would like to point out that some of the students have the economic pressure. To work for an year really release the pressure.

However, not all of people suits for the gap year. For some students who already make up their mind or they already know what they want to do, travleing or working for a year really waste their time. They can not get a good pay if they only graduate from high school. They may sacrifice their best time to study to get realy life things.
Besides, they may learn some bad habit for their future study. for instance, some people may learn to have alcohol or pursue the fashion too much. Some of them are not big deal, some of them are really bad for higher education.

Both ways has both their supporters. I would suggest that if the youngsters doesn't make up their mind, They'd better to have a gap year. But for some students who already make a draft of their career. They should go to the university directly.

It's typical (orig: more often) to see some people to have a gap year after they graduate from high school and before they enter to the college. There are (orig: It has) both pros and cons. For many aspect, I am in favor of travelling to know what's they want. (Orig: I am in favor of going out if they don't know what they exactly want.)  I'll discuss both of the view points below.

summary: 	typical比more often好。
		I am in favor of going out...
			直接換成I am in favor of travelling ....比較直覺。


To start with, in my country, most students only know how to study and how to pass a test. They really don't know the actual life and work. Some students even don't understand the difference between software engineering and eletric engineering. They just choose the depart by the order. Therefore, to travel or work can really help them to know the real world. Moreover, travelling and working can broader their view and enlarge their personal resources. They can get more advice to help them choose what they want to learn and which department they want to enter. Actually, some MBAs only admit the students who have the real work experience. You can not make a cart behind closed doors. Lastly, I would like to point out that some of students have the economic pressure. To work for a year really releases the pressure.


Summary
	Most students 比Most of students 好
		也可用The majority of students

	make a cart behind closed doors. ==>閉門造車

	pass a test (不指定，不要用the)

	real, actual可以互換。

However, the gap year is not necessary for everyone. (orig: not all of people suits for the gap year). For some students who already make up their mind or they alrady know what they want to do, travelling or working for a year really wastes their time(注意wastes, 是單數). They can not get a good pay if they only graduate from high school. They may sacrifice their best time to study to get real life things. Besides, they may learn some bad habit for their future study.  For instance, some people may drink too much or concern about the fashion too much. Some of them are not a big deal some of them are really bad for higher education.



summary:

	the gap year is not necessary for everyone 比 原句(all of poeple suit for the gap year )好
	太重注意時尚使用concern
	concern about the fashion (instad of pursue the fashion)

Both ways have their supporters. I would suggest that if the youngster doesn't make up his mind, they can enjoy their gap year. But for some students who already certain about their career prepartion, they should go to the university directly.

Summary
	用enjoy the gap year取 have a gap year.
	make a draft of their carrer, 可以用 certain about their career preparation 
									或	certain about their study
較好

	suggest that if the youngster doesn't make up his mind (使用單數比youngsters好)
