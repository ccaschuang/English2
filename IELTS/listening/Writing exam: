Writing exam:

1: You just came back from a holiday and you are not happy about the hotel you stayed in. You want to write a letter to the manager about the dirty room, the noisy guests next door, the bad food in the restaurant and the lack of towels for the swimming pool. Let's think about what we can say about these problems. We have to expand on our answers and give detail. Always plan before you write. Without planning, your writing will not be organized and you will not get a good mark on the exam. To get started: how is the room dirty? Think of possible situations. Now do this for the other compliants you have . Use the space below to write down your ideas and plan.


1: Note that we have ideas, we can decide what we want to include. Check the question very carefully so you know exactly what you have to write about. For example, do you have to write about a problem or problems? Type your letter on a computer, turning the spellcheck function off and print it out. How long did it take? How many typing errors did you make?
