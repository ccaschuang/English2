No single culture could define Canada

The Government of Canada, under Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau, declared in 1971 that Canada would adopt a multicultural policy.[2] The Government of Canada would recognize and respect its society including its diversity in languages, customs, religions, and so on.[3] In 1982, multiculturalism was recognized by section 27 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.[4] The Canadian Multiculturalism Act was then enacted by Prime Minister Brian Mulroney
