I think children should wear uniform to school. Because I strongly believe that it is essential for giving children a sense of identify and unity. Young children can be very snobbish about fashion and often ridicule and pick on children who don't wear designer clothes. If all children wear a uniform, they will all look the same so no one can discriminated.
