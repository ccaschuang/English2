I heard you are moving out of Ontario and you're going to British Columbia.

You need to make a list of the important thing you might need to take with you and all the required documents that you need to take.

After you get there, I advise you to get blending with the people there and try to find friends. As many friends as you can because of getting to know new people would help you to settle there easier.

Commuting would be really expensive it's one of the major things to pay attention to.

I wish you luck.
