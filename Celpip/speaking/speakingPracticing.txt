I'm looking at a gorgeous oil painting. 
It's a water scene showing two rowboats tied up to a rickety pier, with a third one out in the water. There is some kind of tall thin building in the background on the right -- maybe a refinery.　The most striking thing about the painting is the sky, which is deep shades of orange and red, and these colors are reflected in the water. Maybe the sun is rising, because there are intense blue and indigo colors in the top right that look like a night sky, while all the orange and red colors in the rest of the picture feels like the sunrise. I think maybe this is a small village, and this is a typcial scene before the boats go out fishing for the day.
