===== Questions:
Company Survey

Your company is thinking of creating a facility in one of its floors. The Human Resources Department of your company is surveying your opinion on what to have. The major question is whether the company should build a gym or a child care center.

Choose the option that you prefer. Why do you prefer your choice? Explain the reasons for your choice. Write about 150-200 words.

Option A:

Gym: This gym would include a basketball court, exercising equipment, and shower rooms.

Option B:

Child care center: This center would include a playground, a green area, and some classrooms.
=======

I prefer option A - a gym for the following reasons.

First of all, we don't have many places to exercise here. It takes us 30 minutes to walk to the closest gym. If we have a gym downstairs, we have more motivations to do physical activities. It not only saves the commuting time, but also eliminates the excuse not exercising.

Moreover, sometimes our IT(including me) have to stay till midnight to do the maintenance jobs. There are some time gaps here. A gym and shower rooms can really help us to kill the time and keep our body healthy. I can do some yoga and then use equipments to stimulate my muscles. After that, I can take a shower and go out for supper. Shower rooms really help us keeping neat in the office.

Last but not least, a gym can be used by all our employees, but a child care center can only be used by colleagues who have children. 

In summary, I strongly recommend building a gym rather than a child care center. It fits all employees' need and more convenient for us.
