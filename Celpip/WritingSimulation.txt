Read the following information.

You and your family visit the local shopping mall every week. However, it has become more and more difficult to find a parking spot recently. You would like to let the shopping mall manager know about this problem.

Write an email to the mall manager in about 150-200 words. Your email should do the following things:

Describe the problem you are having with the mallâ€™s parking.
Explain what you and your family have to do in order to visit the shopping mall now.
Provide some suggestions for how the mall manager can solve this problem.

To whom it may concern,

My family and I  are your loyal customer and we go to the mall every week. I noticed that it's harder and harder to find a parking lot recently. Sometimes it took me more than 15 minutes to find a parking spot. 

We always go to the mall and have our lunch on weekend. After that, we usually have some entertainment here, like see a movie, buy our clothes or groceries. And then we'll go to Safeway to buy the foods we need for that week.

I don't mind walking another 10 minutes from a parking space to the mall, but the problem is that I can not even find a spot. The followings are my observations and suggestions.

1: I noticed that a lot of cars never leave. I'll suggest that you should start to limit parking time to 2~4 hours. Besides,
2: It's quite open on the east side of the mall. Is it possible to rent it and allow the customers to park there? 

Thanks for reading my email, I hope that you can sort this out and I believe that it can make you have higher customer satisfaction.

Sincerely,
ccas

Childcare Survey

You work in a very big office. There is a popular and cheap restaurant in the building. The boss is thinking of removing the restaurant and replacing it with a childcare facility for the working mothers in the office. You have been asked to respond to an opinion survey. 

Choose the option that you prefer. Why do you prefer your choice? Explain the reasons for your choice. Write about 150-200 words.

Option A: I think we should keep the restaurant.

I think we should keep the restaurant for the following reasons.

First, if we cut the restaurant, we'll not have enough restaurant here. We have to either open another restaurant, or most of co-workers need to take 15 minutes walk to the restaurant to have lunch and another 15 minutes to walk back. It's kind of waste for the company. 

Second, our customers like this restaurant, too. I saw some sales like to have lunch and coffee in the restaurant. The sales might be sad and they need to find another restaurant to treat the customers.

Last but not least, there is a childcare just next to our building and I know that a lot of our co-workers send their babies there in the morning and pick them up after work. To cooperate with that childcare would be a very good option. We don't need to start a new childcare facility ourselves.

To sum up, I think that we should keep the restaurant and cooperate with the childcare next to our building. it's faster and we don't need to reopen a new childcare facility.
